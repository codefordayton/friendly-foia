## Docker Usage

If you do not have Docker installed on your computer, follow the instructions here: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

### Build the Docker Image

From the `friendly-requests-server` directory:

```shell
docker build -t codefordayton/friendly-requests-server .
```

If the build succeeds, you should see output similar to the following:
```
Successfully built 8214ed5bee38
Successfully tagged codefordayton/friendly-requests-server:latest
```

### Run the Docker Image

To start the image in a container, run the following command
```shell
docker run -d --rm -p 5000:5000 -e DEBUG=True codefordayton/friendly-requests-server
```

The `-d` flag starts the container in the background (detached mode).

The `--rm` flag automatically cleans up and removes the container when it exits.

The `-p` flag specifies the ports to use. In this example, port 5000 on the host (your computer) is mapped to port 5000 in the Docker container.

The `-e` flag specifies an environment variable. In this case, debug mode is turned on. Set this value to `False` or omit the environment variable to turn debug mode off.

If the container started successfully, you should see a long string of digits and letters in your console, similar to:
```shell
785e59eb07f5e3155784761c17f12374f27e8dffd9f741518d17dcfcc2cace4c
```

To test the server, run:
```shell
curl -d '{"department_name":"Department of Things"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate > downloaded.docx
```

This will download a Microsoft Word document (.docx extension), which you should be able to open and edit.

### TODO

Update the Dockerfile to generate a production-ready Docker image.
